# WineQuality_End_to_End_ML_MidTerm_Project
## Problem
Predict the quality (score 0-10) of red wine from physicochemical tests. This is a regression problem that demonstrates EDA, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model serialization, containerized serving, and basic reproducibility.

## Files
- `data/` — put `winequality-red.csv` here
- `notebook.ipynb` — exploratory notebook (EDA, training experiments)
- `train.py` — training script that saves `model.joblib`
- `predict.py` — FastAPI service that loads `model.joblib`
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` — builds a container serving the API with Uvicorn
- `model.joblib` — saved artifact (generated by `train.py`)

## How to run
1. Create venv and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # on Windows: run the activate script in .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
